# Drop-Dead-Dice-Game

Drop Dead is a simple dice game. Each player rolls the dice and if they roll a 2 or a 5, the dice with 2 or 5 are removed, 
and the remaining dice are tallied up and added to that players score. When there are no dice remaining, the next player gets
their turn.

In the future, I would like to add traditional dice faces to the dice and implement a multiplayer mode, which would make this significantly
more fun to play. I would also like to save high scores to local storage and display them.
